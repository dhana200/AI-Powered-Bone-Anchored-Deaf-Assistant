##This project was inspired by a survey that involved the questioning of hearing-impaired people and how they feel about the
working of current hearing aids. Most of them felt that the traditional hearing aids did not amplify the audio signal above the
considerable levels. So to make these hearing aids work to its maximum capacity, we, a team of 4 people, decided to create an 
advanced hearing aid which perceives the surrounding environment using CNN network and accordingly optimize the audio signals
based on the surrounding using GAN network which was introduced a few years back in 2014. We also decided to use Bone Conduction 
Technology to send the optimized audio signal directly to the inner ear which can be more easily perceived by the brain.
